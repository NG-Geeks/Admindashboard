How the Application Works
User Authentication: Upon logging in, the application checks if the user is authorized and redirects them to the appropriate dashboard (Admin or User).
User Dashboard: Regular users can view their profile, permissions, and account details, but they cannot modify permissions.
Admin Dashboard: Admin users have access to manage user permissions, manage accounts, and oversee content across the platform.
Permissions Management: Admins can assign or remove permissions (Read, Write, Delete) for individual users based on their roles.
Admin Dashboard Features
User Management: View and manage users, including the ability to edit roles and permissions.
Permission Management: Admin users can assign or modify user permissions to grant access to specific actions like reading, writing, or deleting content.
Account Info: Admins and users can view their personal account details, such as username, email, and role.
Admin-Only Pages: Certain features and pages are available only to admins, ensuring that sensitive data and actions are protected.
